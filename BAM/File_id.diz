BUST-A-MOVE 2(tm) PC DEMO 
The idea is to burst colored bubbles by linking any three 
bubbles of the same color.  The game is over once a bubble gets 
crowded over the bottom line.  To be a top scorer, you've got 
to burst as many bubbles as possible!  But the real trick here is 
learning how to strategically angle your shots.  Only a lot of 
practice will home your aim, end your shame and assure you fame!
