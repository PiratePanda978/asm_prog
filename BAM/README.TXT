                Welcome to BUST-A-MOVE 2: Arcade Edition Demo.



                     <<<<<<< Installation Notes >>>>>>>
 
        Bust-A-Move 2: Arcade Edition must be installed onto your hardrive
        in order to work properly.  The INSTALL.BAT file automatically copies
        all of the files from a Bust-A-Move 2 CD into a directory called
        C:\ACCLAIM\BAM2DEMO.  If you wish to install the files into another
        directory, we recommend using the XCOPY command.

        To exit the game at any time and return to your operating system
        (DOS prompt), press ESC.

        If you downloaded the demo from the internet and you have a 
        Saturn version of Bust-A-Move 2: Arcade Edition, you can play 
        the game music while playing the demo by inserting your Saturn
        CD in the CD-ROM drive before starting the game.  The demo did not 
        include those sounds because of download time.



                        <<<<<<< Basic Rules >>>>>>>

        Aim bubbles with the keyboard left and right arrow keys, and 
        fire with the spacebar.  Pretty simple, eh?  So simple that 
        you're free to concentrate on playing instead of learning a 
        bunch of rules and controls.  Heck, you don't even need to read 
        the rest of this file.  But I'd appreciate it if you did.



                     <<<<<<< Object of the Game >>>>>>>

        The idea is to burst colored bubbles by linking any three 
        bubbles of the same color.  The game is over once a bubble gets 
        crowded over the bottom line.  To be a top scorer, you've got 
        to burst as many bubbles as possible!  But the real trick here is 
        learning how to strategically angle your shots.  Only a lot of 
        practice will home your aim, end your shame and assure you fame!
